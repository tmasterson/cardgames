THis is primarily an excercise in doing things with go.

At this point it allows the computer to play a game of klondike soitaire as I have not yet put any UI components in.

It still has bugs in that in certain cases it will infinitely loop.  Eventually I may add an ncurses ui component that allows a person to play.

My next step is to refactor it so tests can be better written and allow me to find where and why the infinite loops occur.
